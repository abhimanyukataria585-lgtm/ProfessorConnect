# ProfessorConnect
ProfessorConnect is a web-based platform designed to connect students with retired professors for affordable and personalized academic support.  I worked on developing responsive user interfaces using React.js and JavaScript, profile management, and session booking features, and integrated backend services using Node.js and MongoDB.
